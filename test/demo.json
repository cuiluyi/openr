      "text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: A regular pentagon is rotated counterclockwise about its center. What is the minimum number of degrees it must be rotated until it coincides with its original position? Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out the smallest angle of rotation that will make the pentagon look exactly like it did before. \n\nFirst, I remember that regular polygons have rotational symmetry. That means you can rotate them by certain angles and they'll look the same as before. The key here is to find the smallest such angle, which is called the order of rotational symmetry. \n\nI think the formula for the smallest angle of rotation for a regular polygon is 360 degrees divided by the number of sides. So, for a pentagon, which has 5 sides, it should be 360 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 360 ÷ 5 is 72. So, is it 72 degrees? That seems right because if you rotate a pentagon by 72 degrees, each vertex will move to the position of the next vertex, and the whole shape will coincide with its original position.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. I know that for a square, which has 4 sides, the smallest rotation is 90 degrees because 360 ÷ 4 is 90. So, that makes sense. Similarly, for a hexagon, which has 6 sides, the smallest rotation is 60 degrees because 360 ÷ 6 is 60. So, following that pattern, a pentagon should indeed have a rotation of 72 degrees.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me visualize a regular pentagon. It has five equal sides and five equal angles. If I rotate it by 72 degrees, each vertex will move to the position of the next one. So, the first vertex moves to where the second was, the second moves to where the third was, and so on, until the fifth vertex comes back to where it started. That means the entire pentagon coincides with its original position after a 72-degree rotation.\n\nIs there a possibility that a smaller angle could also work? I don't think so because 72 is the smallest angle that divides evenly into 360. If I tried, say, 36 degrees, that would mean rotating the pentagon 360 ÷ 36, which is 10 times. But that would make the pentagon coincide with its original position after 10 rotations, not just one. So, 72 degrees is the minimal angle needed for the pentagon to coincide with its original position.\n\nAnother way to think about it is in terms of the central angles. Each vertex is equally spaced around the center of the pentagon. The angle between each vertex from the center is 360 ÷ 5, which is 72 degrees. So, rotating the pentagon by that angle would align each vertex with the next one, effectively making the pentagon coincide with its original position.\n\nI also remember that the order of rotational symmetry for a regular polygon is equal to the number of sides. So, for a pentagon, the order is 5. That means you can rotate it 5 times by 72 degrees each time to get back to the starting position. So, 5 times 72 is 360, which brings it back to the original orientation.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if there's any other angle that could also cause the pentagon to coincide. For example, if I rotated it by 18 degrees, that's 360 ÷ 20, which is 18. But 18 doesn't divide evenly into 360 in a way that would make the pentagon coincide. Instead, it would cause the pentagon to coincide with a different polygon, maybe a 20-sided one, but not a pentagon. So, 18 degrees is too small.\n\nSimilarly, 24 degrees would be 360 ÷ 15, which is 24. But again, 24 doesn't divide evenly into 360 in a way that would make the pentagon coincide. Instead, it would cause the pentagon to coincide with a 15-sided polygon, which is a different shape. So, 24 degrees is also too small.\n\nTherefore, 72 degrees is indeed the smallest angle that can be used to rotate the pentagon and have it coincide with its original position. It's the minimal angle that satisfies the condition of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I considered the formula, visualized the pentagon, thought about the central angles, and even checked smaller angles to see if they could work. All of that leads me to conclude that 72 degrees is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum number of degrees is \\boxed{72}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center to coincide with its original position, we need to consider the rotational symmetry of the pentagon.\n\nA regular polygon with \\( n \\) sides has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated by \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} \\) degrees and still look the same. For a pentagon, which has 5 sides, the smallest angle of rotation is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{5} = 72^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis means that rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees will align each vertex with the next one, making the pentagon coincide with its original position. Smaller angles do not divide evenly into 360 degrees in a way that would cause the pentagon to coincide with its original position.\n\nThus, the minimum number of degrees required is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
