    "Okay, so I have this problem here about a cross-country team's training run, and there's a graph with dots representing different students and their positions over time. The question is asking which student has the greatest average speed. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. So, for each student, I need to figure out how far they went and how much time they took, then divide those two numbers to get their average speed. The student with the highest average speed will be the answer.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code provided, it seems like the graph is plotted with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis. Each dot represents a student's position at a specific time. So, for each dot, I can get the coordinates (time, distance). That should help me calculate the distance each student traveled and the time they took.\n\nLet me list out the dots and their corresponding coordinates:\n\n1. **Evelyn**: (1.25, 4.5)\n2. **Briana**: (2.5, 2.2)\n3. **Carla**: (4.25, 5.2)\n4. **Debra**: (5.6, 2.8)\n5. **Angela**: (6.8, 1.4)\n\nWait, hold on. The Asymptote code actually draws the graph with the x-axis from 0 to 8 and the y-axis from 0 to 6. So, each dot is a point on this graph, and the x-coordinate is time, and the y-coordinate is distance. So, for each dot, the x is time, and the y is distance.\n\nSo, to find the average speed, I need to calculate the distance each student traveled and the time they took. Since the graph is plotted with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis, the distance each student traveled is the y-coordinate of their respective dot. The time taken is the x-coordinate of their respective dot.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in a distance-time graph, the slope of the line between two points gives the average speed. So, if I have multiple points, each representing a different time, then the average speed between two points is the change in distance over the change in time. But in this case, each dot is a single point, so maybe I need to calculate the speed between each consecutive pair of dots?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the results of a cross-country team's training run are graphed below.\" So, it's a single graph with multiple dots. So, each dot is a different time point, and each dot's y-coordinate is the distance at that time. So, to find the average speed for each student, I can take the distance at the end of their run minus the distance at the start, divided by the time taken.\n\nBut wait, the graph is plotted with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis, so each dot is a point at a specific time. So, for each student, their average speed is the total distance they covered divided by the total time they took. So, for each student, I can calculate the distance from the starting point (O) to their final position, and the time from the start to their final time.\n\nBut wait, in the graph, the starting point is O, which is (0,0). So, each dot is a point at a specific time, so the distance each student has run is the y-coordinate of their respective dot, and the time is the x-coordinate.\n\nSo, for each student, their average speed is (y-coordinate) / (x-coordinate). So, let me compute that for each student.\n\n1. **Evelyn**: (1.25, 4.5)\n   - Distance: 4.5 units\n   - Time: 1.25 units\n   - Speed: 4.5 / 1.25 = 3.6 units per time unit\n\n2. **Briana**: (2.5, 2.2)\n   - Distance: 2.2 units\n   - Time: 2.5 units\n   - Speed: 2.2 / 2.5 = 0.88 units per time unit\n\n3. **Carla**: (4.25, 5.2)\n   - Distance: 5.2 units\n   - Time: 4.25 units\n   - Speed: 5.2 / 4.25 ≈ 1.214 units per time unit\n\n4. **Debra**: (5.6, 2.8)\n   - Distance: 2.8 units\n   - Time: 5.6 units\n   - Speed: 2.8 / 5.6 = 0.5 units per time unit\n\n5. **Angela**: (6.8, 1.4)\n   - Distance: 1.4 units\n   - Time: 6.8 units\n   - Speed: 1.4 / 6.8 ≈ 0.205 units per time unit\n\nSo, now I have the average speeds for each student:\n\n- Evelyn: 3.6\n- Briana: 0.88\n- Carla: ≈1.214\n- Debra: 0.5\n- Angela: ≈0.205\n\nComparing these, the highest average speed is 3.6 units per time unit, which belongs to **Evelyn**.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with **Evelyn**: 4.5 divided by 1.25. Let me compute that:\n\n1.25 goes into 4.5 how many times? 1.25 * 3 = 3.75, 1.25 * 3.6 = 4.5. So, yes, 3.6 is correct.\n\n**Briana**: 2.2 / 2.5. 2.5 goes into 2.2 0.88 times. Correct.\n\n**Carla**: 5.2 / 4.25. Let me compute that. 4.25 * 1 = 4.25, 4.25 * 1.2 = 5.1, which is very close to 5.2. So, 1.214 is correct.\n\n**Debra**: 2.8 / 5.6. That's 0.5. Correct.\n\n**Angela**: 1.4 / 6.8. Let me compute that. 6.8 goes into 1.4 about 0.205 times. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the student with the greatest average speed is **Evelyn**.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me visualize the graph. The x-axis is time, and the y-axis is distance. So, each dot is a point on this graph. So, the further to the right a dot is, the more time has passed, and the higher up it is on the y-axis, the more distance has been covered.\n\nSo, for each student, their average speed is the slope of the line from the origin (0,0) to their respective point (time, distance). So, the slope is rise over run, which is distance over time, which is exactly the average speed.\n\nSo, if I compute the slope for each student, it should give me their average speed.\n\nLet me compute the slope for each student:\n\n1. **Evelyn**: (4.5, 1.25)\n   - Slope: 4.5 / 1.25 = 3.6\n\n2. **Briana**: (2.2, 2.5)\n   - Slope: 2.2 / 2.5 = 0.88\n\n3. **Carla**: (5.2, 4.25)\n   - Slope: 5.2 / 4.25 ≈ 1.214\n\n4. **Debra**: (2.8, 5.6)\n   - Slope: 2.8 / 5.6 = 0.5\n\n5. **Angela**: (1.4, 6.8)\n   - Slope: 1.4 / 6.8 ≈ 0.205\n\nSo, same results as before. So, the slopes are 3.6, 0.88, 1.214, 0.5, and 0.205.\n\nTherefore, the highest slope is 3.6, which is for **Evelyn**.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that **Evelyn** has the greatest average speed.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about what average speed means. It's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, for each student, if they went further in the same amount of time, they have a higher average speed.\n\nLooking at the graph, the dots are plotted at different times and distances. So, for each student, their average speed is determined by how much distance they covered in the time they were on the training run.\n\nSo, for example, **Evelyn** is at (1.25, 4.5). So, she started at O (0,0) and went to (1.25, 4.5). So, her distance is 4.5, and her time is 1.25. So, 4.5 / 1.25 is 3.6.\n\nSimilarly, **Briana** went from (0,0) to (2.5, 2.2), so 2.2 / 2.5 is 0.88.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is the graph showing the entire training run or just a part of it? The problem says \"the results of a cross-country team's training run are graphed below.\" So, it's the entire training run, so all the dots are part of the same training run.\n\nTherefore, each student's average speed is determined by their entire run, from the start (O) to their final position.\n\nSo, in that case, the calculation I did is correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that **Evelyn** has the greatest average speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe student with the greatest average speed is \\boxed{Evelyn}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which student has the greatest average speed, we need to calculate the average speed for each student. Average speed is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\nEach student's position is represented by a dot on a graph with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis. The coordinates of each dot are:\n\n1. **Evelyn**: (1.25, 4.5)\n2. **Briana**: (2.5, 2.2)\n3. **Carla**: (4.25, 5.2)\n4. **Debra**: (5.6, 2.8)\n5. **Angela**: (6.8, 1.4)\n\nWe calculate the average speed for each student by dividing their y-coordinate (distance) by their x-coordinate (time):\n\n1. **Evelyn**: \\(\\frac{4.5}{1.25} = 3.6\\)\n2. **Briana**: \\(\\frac{2.2}{2.5} = 0.88\\)\n3. **Carla**: \\(\\frac{5.2}{4.25} \\approx 1.214\\)\n4. **Debra**: \\(\\frac{2.8}{5.6} = 0.5\\)\n5. **Angela**: \\(\\frac{1.4}{6.8} \\approx 0.205\\)\n\nThe highest average speed is 3.6 units per time unit, which belongs to **Evelyn**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{Evelyn}\n\\]",
